This is a basic GitHub Actions example. It is taken from:
https://dev.to/chigozieco/automate-build-test-deploy-processes-with-github-actions-5b4e

When an attempt is made to push into the main branch,
GitHub action push setups up a build, test, and deploy pipeline---
---again--
---testing actions by making chnage here and commit it---
